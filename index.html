  [32m- System Calls & Employee Salary (C++)[0m
    A low-level C++ project that uses POSIX system calls to build a persistent,
    file-based hash table for storing and retrieving employee salaries. It parses
    a text file, handles collisions with linear probing, and writes to a binary
    file for fast lookups.

  [32m- Interprocess Communication (IPC) (C++)[0m
    A C++ program demonstrating bidirectional interprocess communication using
    unnamed pipes and forked processes. The parent reads from a source file and
    sends data to a child, which writes it to both the terminal and a new file,
    then returns the character count. Built for Unix-like systems using low-level
    POSIX calls.

  [32m- Flashcards Web App (React)[0m
    A simple flashcard app built in React for interactive studying. Displays a deck
    with a title, description, and total cards. Users can flip cards to see answers
    and click to view random cards.
